  "Summary": "I gained experience in programming through my own projects and work as an entrepreneur. I am skilled in various areas of programming, but I am particularly interested in web development, specifically Front-End. In addition to my drawing skills, I am capable of handling graphic tasks, and I am also comfortable in the UX/UI field. I can implement meticulously designed layouts with pixel-perfect precision. I can find solutions to mathematical problems that arise during development. I place a strong emphasis on creating code that is easy to read, maintain, and well-structured. Learning is one of my hobbies, and I enjoy exploring new technologies or delving deeper into the ones I already know. I feel that I have developed successfully on my own so far, but working in a team at a company provides a different perspective on the profession and offers valuable new experiences. I would also appreciate the opportunity to use the English language verbally in my daily work. I would like to join a team that helps me grow and gain new experiences in the field."
